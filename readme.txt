Removes given local enqueued script handles and places their content into the head. Useful for small scripts with a size lower than ~500 Bytes to boost site performance. Caution: Use with care and sparingly!

== Description ==
In some cases you cannot wait for a JavaScript file to load, even if it is placed early in the `<head>` section of your template. You can benefit from better performance, if you place the JavaScript code directly inside a `<script>` tag into the header. This is where this plugin comes in: It provides a filter `inline_javascript_in_head_handles`, which takes JavaScript handles, dequeues those scripts and echos their code content inline into the wp_head section instead of linking them via a script tag.

Please beware that placing lots of JavaScript code inline in the `<head>` section can be critical. First you lose caching benefits and second the general document size can increase easily. A general rule of thumb is that you should only consider JavaScript files for inline placement, which are critical and which have a file size lower than ~500 Bytes.

= Example =

```
add_action( 'wp_enqueue_scripts', 'my_scripts' );
function my_scripts() {
	// Some critical script is enqueued
	wp_enqueue_script( 'js-detection', get_template_directory_uri() . '/js/js-detection.js' );
}

/**
 * Define JavaScript handles to be echoed inline in the html head section via `Inline JavaScript in Head` plugin.
 */
add_filter( 'inline_javascript_in_head_handles', 'my_inline_javascript_in_head_handles', -20 );
function my_inline_javascript_in_head_handles( $handles ) {
	$scripts = [ 'js-detection' ];

	return array_merge( $handles, $scripts );
}
```
